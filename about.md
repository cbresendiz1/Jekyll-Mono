My name is Charly Resendiz, a recent alumni of Drexel University. Most of my experience with software comes from independent projects with C, CUDA, and Haskell in
atmospheric and oceanic modeling, programming language development, and low level tooling. I've interned at PJM Interconnection LLC, developing and maintaining internal sites.
In addition, I've interned at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), under Engility, a private defense contractor. My interests are, primarily, in Haskell development,
application of dependent types in development, and software verification.
